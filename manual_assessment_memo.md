# Manual Assessment Memo

MEMORANDUM 
TO: Dell
FROM: Benjamin Graydon
SUBJECT: Recommendation for Dell G15 5520 service manual
DATE: 2/13/2025

I reviewed the Dell G15 5520 laptop service manual like I was requested, link to the manual is: Dell G15 5520 Service Manual | Dell US

Upon studying this manual, I instantly saw its strengths, it covers the topics it sets out to in detail showing information like what screws are used or what. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to disassemble replace then reassemble parts of the laptop, including the necessary warning when dealing with electronics. The strengths are not only in what information is provided, but in how it is. The manual breaks down the complicated steps associated with the Dell G15 5520 and breaks it down into easily digestible pieces. The manual also makes great use of color highlighting the warnings in red, notices in yellow, and key components in blue making it easy for the user to quickly glance to find solutions to a problem.

As far as weakness is concerned, there are a few. The formatting of tables that go from one page to another is lacking the bottom bar, making it look out of place. Then on the next page it adds another header to the table, this creates some confusion making it hard to understand the table. Another area that can be used is the use of acronyms and complex verbiage, while some complexities are expected, I believe the manual could benefit from a description of words and concepts that are integral to the manual. Another weakness is that the manual only shows the disassembly up to a certain point, lacking the ability to show how to remove the keyboard, since the keyboard is one of the most used parts of the laptop it should be included on how to service it.
To improve the manual, I recommend:
–	Fixing the formatting of the tables, from page to page.
–	Add a description for more complex concepts in the manual.
–	Extend the disassembly to include keyboard.
AI statement: I used spellcheck to improve this assignment.
