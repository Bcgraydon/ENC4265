# Welcome to my Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
Hello, my name is Benjamin Graydon. I began attending the University of Central Florida (UCF) in Fall 2024 after studying at Gulf Coast State College, where I worked toward my Associate of Arts degree. I am currently pursuing a major in Information Technology with a minor in Secure Computing and Networking. My ultimate career goal is to work in cybersecurity, though I understand that breaking into this field often involves starting in related roles, so I am focused on gaining the skills and experience necessary to achieve that goal.

In October 2020, I joined the United States Marine Corps Reserves, motivated by a desire to serve my country while pursuing my education. I have achieved the rank of Non-Commissioned Officer and received training in all-source intelligence analysis as well as other specialized skills.
