# Wayback Analysis
## Introduction
The first webpage was created on August 6th 1991, it was just a wall of text and links explain what the World Wide Web project was. You can still visit the page today, it’s a stark reminder of how far web development has gone in the past three decades since the first one was made. Every successful website developed in todays age it made with the user in mind, everything from color of the background, to size of the text is calculated to make the experience as user friendly as possible.

## Analysis
The Wayback Machine is a website that stores snapshots of a website throughout its development. I used this machine to see what YouTube.com looked like in 2007, only two years after its creation. YouTube is a free video sharing platform, used by people to find a video on just about any topic. I use it daily for entertainment, but that’s not its only use its my go to website for technical repair tutorials, software setups, and extra help on course work. It is clear that YouTube today and YouTube of 2007 are similar, but it is obvious that it is extremely dated in today’s standards, here are the key differences I noticed.
### Layout
-All the information displayed from the videos, to the search bar are blocky boxes with sharp corners, coming from the modern website it is clear that the newer way of displaying them with rounded corners and soft edges is more alleging to the eye.

-Ads on the dated site are placed in poor locations, distracting the user from the videos, and they ruin the experience, compared to YouTube now where the Ads are clearly placed in locations as to not distract while also allowing for effective marketing.

### Navigation
-It is clear the older site relies a lot on text links, with limited uses of menus. The modern site has common since menus that makes it predecessor feel dated.

## Conclusion
Its interesting to think that when the first website was created you could have gave the URL for the website to just about anyone in the world and they wouldn’t know what to do with it, and how you can give a URL to just about any kid in elementary school and they could navigate to the site easily. Humans ability to use the internet has evolved and so has our ability to design a visually appealing, and effective website. This analysis of YouTube is just one example a modern website compared to its younger self, it clearly show the improvement in layout, and Navigation. It will be interesting to see in the next couple of decades if YouTube is still there, the improvements made upon the version we see now, maybe it will make us think how did we think this looks good.

# Quick Start Guide

## Introduction
In the modern age there are a couple of things in every house hold that people dread setting up, one of those being a network router and modem. Homes didn’t start getting Wi-Fi until the early 2000’s, but they were still bulky, hard to set up, and little was known on how to set one up to have it be most effective. In this guide I will be showing you how to set up a home network and router, to have a effective home network. 
## Glossary
- IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)-A unique numerical label assigned to devices
on a network.
- SSID (Service Set Identifier)- A name used to identify a wireless network.
- ISP- Internet Service Provider.
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network of connected devices within your home,
typically through Wi-Fi or Ethernet cables.
- DNS (Domain Name System): A system that translates human-readable domain
names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses used by computers to locate each
other on the internet.

## Items needed.

- Router
- Modem
- Ethernet cables
- End devices (Computer, Phones, Laptop)
- Internet Service Provider-Power strip (optional)
- Screwdriver (if needed)
## Quick start
1. Gather Supplies.
2. Connect Hardware.
3. Configure Router.
4. Configure Wi-Fi.
5. Connect end devices.
6. Test the Network.
## Steps

### Step 1- Gather the Supplies.

- You can buy a router, and modem combo, or buy your own router and have your ISP
provide a modem to rent or buy.
- All other supplies can be bought at an Electonic store like Best Buy.



### Step 2- Connect Hardware.

- Plug your modem into the wall, keep in mind the modem needs to reach the router
via the ethernet cable you purchased.
- Keep in mind you want your router to be placed in your home in such a way as to
maximize its connection to the end devices, like if you have an office where most of
your end devices are you can place the router in there to have the best connection
centered there.

### Step 3- Configure Router.

- Access router: connect to the router via one of its ethernet cable with a computer or
connect to the Wi-Fi via the default SSID located on the router or in the manual.
- Open a web browser and enter the router's default IP address (usually something like
192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
- Login into the router by entering the default credentials usually found in the manual.



### Step 4- Configure Wi-Fi.

- Change your Wi-Fi SSID to be unique to you, also set a strong password to secure
your network.
- Choose Wi-Fi Security: Select WPA3, WPA2, or WPA3/WPA2 Mixed as your Wi-Fi
security protocol.

## AI statment
#### This assignment was created without the use of AI, this is a work of my own.

Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 

## Introdution 
I asked ChatGPT’s resume AI what position it thought was most suited for based off my resume, and it returned what I wanted it to. I set up my resume to be tailored to a IT/Cyber security role because that the industry I’m wanting to get into, so I’m happy it that the AI was able to determine that.

## Changes
 I then asked the AI to revise my resume to make me more appealing to employers looking for people for those roles, here’s the edits they said to make

 - Use stronger verbiage- The AI told me to use vocabulary that shows my experience more impactful
 - Quantification- The AI told me to add numbers to accomplishments where possible.
 - Keyword optimization- The AI told me to use more words aligned with  IT and Cybersecurity job descriptions
 - Enhance readability- Improve formatting for quick scanning by recruiters

## Overview
I have used AI in the past to revise my resume in the past, it is a great tool to help someone with no experience in the industry to advance. In this exercise I got exactly what I thought I was going to get out of it, improvement. There is always something one can improve on, when it comes to resumes there is no perfect display of ones accomplishments and abilities that can be put on one page, but getting close is really the goal. I added the recommended changes to my resume and I’m continuing to submit it so we will see how it ends up.

Prompt D: Explore an online tutorial, manual, or reference guide/FAQ page. Give it an honest but professional assessment. Describe in your post the aspects of the page(s) that are effective, and explain why. Describe the aspects of the page(s) that are ineffective, and explain why. Keep a professional tone, as though you expect the author(s) of the page(s) to read your post. 

## Introduction 
In the modern age everything we own gets more complicated every day. This makes completing repairs youself with no help nearly imposible, luckly there are copious amounts of tutorials online to help you along the way. I routinely repair my own stuff, just because it fascinates me, and I have a desire to know how the stuff around me works. I have had to use many online tutorials, I have seen good ones and bad ones.

## Review of the tutorial
The tutorial I’m reviewing in this assignment is Oculus Quest 2 Controller Disassembly - iFixit Repair Guide.
