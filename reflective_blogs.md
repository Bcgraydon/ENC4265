# Wayback Analysis
## Introduction
The first webpage was created on August 6th 1991, it was just a wall of text and links explain what the World Wide Web project was. You can still visit the page today, it’s a stark reminder of how far web development has gone in the past three decades since the first one was made. Every successful website developed in todays age it made with the user in mind, everything from color of the background, to size of the text is calculated to make the experience as user friendly as possible.

## Analysis
The Wayback Machine is a website that stores snapshots of a website throughout its development. I used this machine to see what YouTube.com looked like in 2007, only two years after its creation. YouTube is a free video sharing platform, used by people to find a video on just about any topic. I use it daily for entertainment, but that’s not its only use its my go to website for technical repair tutorials, software setups, and extra help on course work. It is clear that YouTube today and YouTube of 2007 are similar, but it is obvious that it is extremely dated in today’s standards, here are the key differences I noticed.
### Layout
-All the information displayed from the videos, to the search bar are blocky boxes with sharp corners, coming from the modern website it is clear that the newer way of displaying them with rounded corners and soft edges is more alleging to the eye.

-Ads on the dated site are placed in poor locations, distracting the user from the videos, and they ruin the experience, compared to YouTube now where the Ads are clearly placed in locations as to not distract while also allowing for effective marketing.

### Navigation
-It is clear the older site relies a lot on text links, with limited uses of menus. The modern site has common since menus that makes it predecessor feel dated.

## Conclusion
Its interesting to think that when the first website was created you could have gave the URL for the website to just about anyone in the world and they wouldn’t know what to do with it, and how you can give a URL to just about any kid in elementary school and they could navigate to the site easily. Humans ability to use the internet has evolved and so has our ability to design a visually appealing, and effective website. This analysis of YouTube is just one example a modern website compared to its younger self, it clearly show the improvement in layout, and Navigation. It will be interesting to see in the next couple of decades if YouTube is still there, the improvements made upon the version we see now, maybe it will make us think how did we think this looks good.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
