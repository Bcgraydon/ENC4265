# Wayback Analysis
## Introduction
The first webpage was created on August 6th 1991, it was just a wall of text and links explain what the World Wide Web project was. You can still visit the page today, it’s a stark reminder of how far web development has gone in the past three decades since the first one was made. Every successful website developed in todays age it made with the user in mind, everything from color of the background, to size of the text is calculated to make the experience as user friendly as possible.

## Analysis
The Wayback Machine is a website that stores snapshots of a website throughout its development. I used this machine to see what YouTube.com looked like in 2007, only two years after its creation. YouTube is a free video sharing platform, used by people to find a video on just about any topic. I use it daily for entertainment, but that’s not its only use its my go to website for technical repair tutorials, software setups, and extra help on course work. It is clear that YouTube today and YouTube of 2007 are similar, but it is obvious that it is extremely dated in today’s standards, here are the key differences I noticed.
### Layout
-All the information displayed from the videos, to the search bar are blocky boxes with sharp corners, coming from the modern website it is clear that the newer way of displaying them with rounded corners and soft edges is more alleging to the eye.

-Ads on the dated site are placed in poor locations, distracting the user from the videos, and they ruin the experience, compared to YouTube now where the Ads are clearly placed in locations as to not distract while also allowing for effective marketing.

### Navigation
-It is clear the older site relies a lot on text links, with limited uses of menus. The modern site has common since menus that makes it predecessor feel dated.

## Conclusion
Its interesting to think that when the first website was created you could have gave the URL for the website to just about anyone in the world and they wouldn’t know what to do with it, and how you can give a URL to just about any kid in elementary school and they could navigate to the site easily. Humans ability to use the internet has evolved and so has our ability to design a visually appealing, and effective website. This analysis of YouTube is just one example a modern website compared to its younger self, it clearly show the improvement in layout, and Navigation. It will be interesting to see in the next couple of decades if YouTube is still there, the improvements made upon the version we see now, maybe it will make us think how did we think this looks good.

# Quick Start Guide

## Introduction
In the modern age there are a couple of things in every house hold that people dread setting up, one of those being a network router and modem. Homes didn’t start getting Wi-Fi until the early 2000’s, but they were still bulky, hard to set up, and little was known on how to set one up to have it be most effective. In this guide I will be showing you how to set up a home network and router, to have a effective home network. 
## Glossary
- IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)-A unique numerical label assigned to devices
on a network.
- SSID (Service Set Identifier)- A name used to identify a wireless network.
- ISP- Internet Service Provider.
- LAN (Local Area Network): A network of connected devices within your home,
typically through Wi-Fi or Ethernet cables.
- DNS (Domain Name System): A system that translates human-readable domain
names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses used by computers to locate each
other on the internet.

## Items needed.

- Router
- Modem
- Ethernet cables
- End devices (Computer, Phones, Laptop)
- Internet Service Provider-Power strip (optional)
- Screwdriver (if needed)
## Quick start
1. Gather Supplies.
2. Connect Hardware.
3. Configure Router.
4. Configure Wi-Fi.
5. Connect end devices.
6. Test the Network.
## Steps

### Step 1- Gather the Supplies.

- You can buy a router, and modem combo, or buy your own router and have your ISP
provide a modem to rent or buy.
- All other supplies can be bought at an Electonic store like Best Buy.



### Step 2- Connect Hardware.

- Plug your modem into the wall, keep in mind the modem needs to reach the router
via the ethernet cable you purchased.
- Keep in mind you want your router to be placed in your home in such a way as to
maximize its connection to the end devices, like if you have an office where most of
your end devices are you can place the router in there to have the best connection
centered there.

  This image shows a example of where the best router placment would be.

### Step 3- Configure Router.

- Access router: connect to the router via one of its ethernet cable with a computer or
connect to the Wi-Fi via the default SSID located on the router or in the manual.
- Open a web browser and enter the router's default IP address (usually something like
192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
- Login into the router by entering the default credentials usually found in the manual.



### Step 4- Configure Wi-Fi.

- Change your Wi-Fi SSID to be unique to you, also set a strong password to secure
your network.
- Choose Wi-Fi Security: Select WPA3, WPA2, or WPA3/WPA2 Mixed as your Wi-Fi
security protocol.

### Step 5- Connect end devices.

- Connect Wi-Fi enabled devices by selecting the SSID in the network settings then
entering the password.
- If you want wired internet connect end devices to the router via ethernet cable.


### Step 6- Test your network.

- On all your end devices, check to make sure you can access the internet.

Prompt Q: Upload your resume (without your address, phone number, and email) to a generative AI tool of your choice (I suggest trying one in Boodlebox). Ask it what position you are best suited for, then ask it to revise your resume to make it more appealing to a future employer in your ideal field. Post: A summary of the suggested changes and a reflection. What did it do? What did you learn? 

## Introdution 
I asked ChatGPT’s resume AI what position it thought was most suited for based off my resume, and it returned what I wanted it to. I set up my resume to be tailored to a IT/Cyber security role because that the industry I’m wanting to get into, so I’m happy it that the AI was able to determine that.

## Changes
 I then asked the AI to revise my resume to make me more appealing to employers looking for people for those roles, here’s the edits they said to make

 - Use stronger verbiage- The AI told me to use vocabulary that shows my experience more impactful
 - Quantification- The AI told me to add numbers to accomplishments where possible.
 - Keyword optimization- The AI told me to use more words aligned with  IT and Cybersecurity job descriptions
 - Enhance readability- Improve formatting for quick scanning by recruiters

## Overview
I have used AI in the past to revise my resume in the past, it is a great tool to help someone with no experience in the industry to advance. In this exercise I got exactly what I thought I was going to get out of it, improvement. There is always something one can improve on, when it comes to resumes there is no perfect display of ones accomplishments and abilities that can be put on one page, but getting close is really the goal. I added the recommended changes to my resume and I’m continuing to submit it so we will see how it ends up.

Prompt D: Explore an online tutorial, manual, or reference guide/FAQ page. Give it an honest but professional assessment. Describe in your post the aspects of the page(s) that are effective, and explain why. Describe the aspects of the page(s) that are ineffective, and explain why. Keep a professional tone, as though you expect the author(s) of the page(s) to read your post. 

## Introduction 
In the modern age everything we own gets more complicated every day. This makes completing repairs youself with no help nearly imposible, luckly there are copious amounts of tutorials online to help you along the way. I routinely repair my own stuff, just because it fascinates me, and I have a desire to know how the stuff around me works. I have had to use many online tutorials, I have seen good ones and bad ones.

## Review of the tutorial
The tutorial I’m reviewing in this assignment is [Oculus Quest 2 Controller Disassembly - iFixit Repair Guide.](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Oculus+Quest+2+Controller+Disassembly/147947).It goes over the steps on how to replace the joystick of the Quest 2 controllers, I recently made this repair so I’m going into this review with the mindset of what would have helped or hurt if I had used this tutorial instead. 
### Positves 
To start off I will go over some of the positives I found. There are a lot of pictures, this is important with a highly technical repair like this one. The steps are clearly laid out, and the grammar used for the steps is professional and appropriate for the setting.
### Negatives
Now some of the negatives for the repair tutorial. The photos for the steps could be more professionally taken, there are a couple that are blurry making it hard to tell what one should be looking at. Another negative about the instructions is that it did not cover the reassembly. When I did this myself there were some key factors to consider, and some helpful tips when reassembling the controllers that are different from disassembling.

## Overview
Tutorials are a tool for the knowledgeable to learn something practical. This tutorial is not any different, it accomplished its exact goal. By the end of reading this you will be able to fix your controller. It explains it well but there are areas that need to be worked on.

Prompt R: After you have completed the Chatbot assignment or any assignment using AI for most of the work, reflect on your interaction with this emerging technology: What does AI do well? What does it not do well? What did you have to correct or re-prompt it to modify? What can you know about its training data? What kinds of data was included? What kinds of data was excluded? What do you think the future holds as this technology is used and further advanced?


## My experince with AI
AI is the newest mainstream technology on the market. As a student of technology, I’ve been intrigued by it, now it’s a tool I use daily, mostly with OpenAI’s learning model that has robust training data. When you start to use AI it’s important to learn its limitations, AI is very good at giving you quick knowledge, but if you’re uneducated on the subject your asking it you won’t catch that it gets things wrong. I’ve used AI many times to research things I already know, or to study a subject I’m learning in class, and I end up having to correct it. Correcting learning models is just where we are in their development, and I’m honestly impressed with the capabilities of the AI we have now, I foresee the growth of AI being something that will be involved in every market, just like the internet.

Prompt F: Reflect on one of your completed Deliverables for this course. What was easy for you? What was more difficult? Why? What did completing this assignment teach you about yourself and technical communication? What would you do differently based on the instructor's feedback? Note: this one is vintage only, but you can use AI tools for editing.

## Refelction on a assignment
The Deliverable I want to reflect on is the chatbot assignment, the last deliverable I completed. The assignment was rather easy because the website has AI tools to help you set your chatbot. The difficulty for me was deciding what platforms I wanted to use to host my chatbot, I went through three websites before I chose the final one, I ended up using. This assignment taught me how easy it is to set up a chatbot, making it a necessity if I ever develop a webpage in the future. I wouldn’t change the assignment after receiving the instructor’s feedback, I might spend more time on it to iron out some edges, but I wouldn’t make any big changes.

Prompt K: Use any generative AI to generate an assignment (or some other piece of writing) that you have already completed. Share the prompt you used, the results you received, and a brief analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the software.

## Introduction
For this assignment I decided to use the past assignment Manual Assessment Memo. The AI software I decided to use was ChatGPT’s 4o model. For the prompt I used certain word to unsure that the software didn’t get confused. I also used bits of the original assignment prompt to ensure it was exactly that I wanted.

## Prompt
I want you to create a memo with this manual. https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/g-series-15-5520-laptop/dell-g15-5520-service-manual/Dell-G15-5520-Service-Manual?guid=guid-dd3ae169-a824-4f1d-832e-585b176f6faf&lang=en-us . The memo will follow proper memo format and etiquette. In this scenario You are a lower-level employee at a company who has been asked to evaluate the company's manual for this one specific product. You need to report your assessment to the CEO of the company (or someone much higher ranking than you) in a professional, emotionally-intelligent way. You don't want to say it's perfect, because they asked you to improve it. But you don't want to say it's terrible, either--someone you work with wrote it! The intended audience is, CEO or other high-level executive at the company that produced the manual. This person is busy and just wants your assessment of the manual at a glance. Your formatting should be easy to skim and be able to be read and understood quickly.

## Results
MEMORANDUM <br /> 
TO: Dell Technologies Executive Team <br /> 
FROM: [Your Name] <br /> 
SUBJECT: Evaluation of Dell G15 5520 Service Manual <br /> 
DATE: March 27, 2025 <br /> 
This memo provides an evaluation of the Dell G15 5520 Service Manual. The assessment is based on usability, clarity, and completeness, with the goal of improving the manual's overall effectiveness. <br /> 
<br /> 
Strengths <br /> 
-	Clear Step-by-Step Instructions: Procedures are sequential and logically ordered, which supports user comprehension.<br /> 
-	High-Quality Visuals: Diagrams and images are sharp, correctly labeled, and help users visually confirm hardware positioning and removal.<br /> 
-	Consistent Formatting: Standardized section layout across all hardware components aids quick reference and navigation.<br /> 
-	Safety Warnings: Proper use of ESD cautions and hazard notes enhances operational safety and equipment care.<br /> 
Areas for Improvement
-	Tool Specifications: The manual lists when tools are required but does not specify the exact type or size. Including this would improve preparedness and reduce trial and error.<br /> 
-	Glossary or Terminology Help: Technical terms like "DC-in connector" or "I/O board" are not defined. Including a glossary would benefit novice technicians or students.<br /> 
-	Troubleshooting Support: The manual focuses on removal and installation but lacks guidance for diagnosing issues or verifying successful repair.<br /> 
-	Paragraph Density: Some sections (e.g., system board removal) use dense blocks of text. These could be broken into bullet points or numbered sub-steps to improve readability. <br />

Recommendations <br /> 
-	Add a tools list, including type and size, at the start of each procedure.<br /> 
-	Include a glossary of hardware terms to aid less experienced users.<br /> 
-	Introduce a troubleshooting appendix or basic diagnostic flowchart.<br /> 
-	Refactor long paragraphs into clearer, more digestible steps.<br /> 

## Analysis
The software did a great job of executing the prompt given too it. For this assignment it was perfect, the software is great at analyzing text for objective reasons allowing it to come up with reasonable suggestions for this manual. For weaknesses the generated text is overly generic and lacks a personal touch, this isn’t a huge issue for this assignment because of the nature of memos but the software still lacks in this area.   


## AI statment
AI was used for the purposes as stated in the prompt, and for editing.
